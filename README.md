# Weather App

Weather App is a UIKit app that displays the weather forecast. The app is built with programatic UI, Combine, and Auto Layout with a MVVM architecture. The forecast is fetched from the [National Weather Service API](https://www.weather.gov/documentation/services-web-api). Currently WIP.
